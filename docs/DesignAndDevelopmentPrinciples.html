            <hr>
            <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c12"><span class="c0">This section describes the design and development methodologies followed
                    for the
                    architecture definition of the OCDS Open Source Central Unit of the electronic public procurement
                    system. The
                    general approach on design of architecture for the eProcurement system involves the Service
                    Oriented
                    Architecture (SOA) and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) architecture. These two approaches combined
                    provide a
                    richer, more robust model by leveraging previously unknown causal relationships in order to build a
                    new event
                    pattern. This new business intelligence pattern triggers further automated processing that adds
                    exponential
                    value to the enterprise by injecting value-added information into the recognized pattern which
                    could not have
                    been previously achieved. </span></p>

            <p class="c12"><span class="c0">Event-driven SOA that combines the intelligence and proactiveness of EDA
                    with the
                    organizational capabilities found in service offerings.</span></p>
            <h3 class="c5" id="h.1fob9te"><span class="c39">Service-oriented architecture </span></h3>
            <p class="c12"><span class="c0">SOA is a style of software design where services are provided to the other
                    components
                    by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. The basic principles of
                    service-oriented architecture are independent of vendors, products and technologies. A service is a
                    discrete
                    unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently, such
                    as
                    retrieving a credit card statement online.</span></p>
            <h3 class="c5" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c39">Event-driven architecture</span></h3>
            <p class="c12"><span class="c0">EDA, is a software architecture pattern promoting the production,
                    detection,
                    consumption of, and reaction to events. From a formal perspective, what is produced, published,
                    propagated,
                    detected or consumed is a (typically asynchronous) message called the event notification, and not
                    the event
                    itself, which is the state change that triggered the message emission. Events do not travel, they
                    just occur.
                    However, the term event is often used metonymically to denote the notification message itself,
                    which may lead
                    to some confusion. Building systems around an event-driven architecture simplifies horizontal
                    scalability in
                    distributed computing models and makes them more resilient to failure. This is because an
                    application state can
                    be copied across multiple parallel snapshots for high-availability. New events can be initiated
                    anywhere, but
                    more importantly propagated across the network of data stores updating each as they arrive. Adding
                    extra nodes
                    becomes easier &nbsp;as well as you can simply take a copy of the application state, feed it a
                    stream of events
                    and run with it. Event-driven architecture can complement SOA because services can be activated by
                    triggers
                    fired on incoming events. This paradigm is particularly useful whenever the sink does not provide
                    any
                    self-contained executive</span></p>
            <h3 class="c5" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c39">CQRS architecture style: command-query separation</span></h3>
            <p class="c12"><span class="c0">In traditional architectures, the same data model is used to query and
                    update a
                    database. That&#39;s simple and works well for basic CRUD operations. In more complex applications,
                    however,
                    this approach can become unwieldy. For example, on the read side, the application may perform many
                    different
                    queries, returning data transfer objects (Data Transfer Objects or DTOs) with different shapes.
                </span></p>
            <p class="c12"><span class="c0">Object mapping can become complicated. On the write side, the model may
                    implement
                    complex validation and business logic. As a result, you can end up with an overly complex model
                    that does too
                    much. Another potential problem is that read and write workloads are often asymmetrical, with very
                    different
                    performance and scale requirements.</span></p>
            <p class="c12"><span class="c0">Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is an architecture
                    which addresses
                    these problems by separating reads and writes into separate models, using commands to update data,
                    and queries
                    to read data.</span></p>
            <ul class="c29 lst-kix_list_8-0 start">
                <li class="c43 c45 c56"><span class="c0">Commands should be task based, rather than data centric.
                        Commands may be
                        placed on a queue for asynchronous processing, rather than being processed synchronously.</span></li>
                <li class="c12 c43"><span class="c0">Queries never modify the database. A query returns a DTO that does
                        not
                        encapsulate any knowledge.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="c12"><span class="c0">Compared to the single data model used in CRUD-based systems, the use of
                    separate query
                    and update models for the data in CQRS-based systems simplifies design and implementation.</span></p><a

            <p class="c12"><span class="c0">For greater isolation, the read and the write data could be physically
                    separated. In
                    that case, the read database can use its own data schema that is optimized for queries. </span></p>
            <p class="c12"><span class="c0">For example, it can store a materialized view of the data, in order to
                    avoid complex
                    joins or mappings. It might even use a different type of data store. If separate read and write
                    databases are
                    used, they must be kept in sync. Typically this is accomplished by having the write model publish
                    an event
                    whenever it updates the DB. </span></p>

            <p class="c12"><span class="c0">Design by contract (DbC), also known as contract programming, programming
                    by contract
                    and design-by-contract programming, is an approach for designing software prescribes that software
                    designers
                    should define formal, precise and verifiable interface specifications for software components,
                    which extend the
                    ordinary definition of abstract data types with preconditions, postconditions and invariants. These
                    specifications are referred to as &quot;contracts&quot;, in accordance with a conceptual metaphor
                    with the
                    conditions and obligations of business contracts. </span></p>
            <p class="c12" id="h.3dy6vkm"><span class="c0">The DbC approach assumes all client components that invoke
                    an operation
                    on a server component will meet the preconditions specified as required for that operation. Where
                    this
                    assumption is considered too risky (as in multi-channel client-server or distributed computing) the
                    opposite
                    &quot;defensive design&quot; approach is taken, meaning that a server component tests (before or
                    while
                    processing a client&#39;s request) that all relevant preconditions hold true, and replies with a
                    suitable error

            <p class="c12"><span class="c0">When storing data, the priority for developers and data administrators is
                    often focused
                    on how the data is stored, as opposed to how it&#39;s read. The chosen storage format is usually
                    closely
                    related to the format of the data, requirements for managing data size and data integrity, and the
                    kind of
                    store in use. For example, when using NoSQL document store, the data is often represented as a
                    series of
                    aggregates, each containing all of the information for that entity. However, this can have a
                    negative effect on
                    queries. When a query only needs a subset of the data from some entities, such as a summary of
                    orders for
                    several customers without all of the order details, it must extract all of the data for the
                    relevant entities
                    in order to obtain the required information.</span></p>
            <h4 class="c28" id="h.17dp8vu"><span class="c19">Solution</span></h4>
            <p class="c11"><span class="c0">To support efficient querying, a common solution is to generate, in
                    advance, a view
                    that materializes the data in a format suited to the required results set. The MV pattern describes
                    generating
                    pre populated views of data in environments where the source data isn&#39;t in a suitable format
                    for querying,
                    where generating a suitable query is difficult, or where query performance is poor due to the
                    nature of the
                    data or the data store. These MVs, which only contain data required by a query, allow applications
                    to quickly
                    obtain the information they need. In addition to joining tables or combining data entities, MVs can
                    include the
                    current values of calculated columns or data items, the results of combining values or executing
                    transformations on the data items, and values specified as part of the query. A MV can even be
                    optimized for
                    just a single query. A key point is that a MV and the data it contains is completely disposable
                    because it can
                    be entirely rebuilt from the source data stores. </span></p>

            <p class="c12"><span class="c0">Instead of storing just the current state of the data in a domain, Event
                    Sourcing uses
                    an append-only store to record the full series of actions taken on that data. The store acts as the
                    system of
                    record and can be used to materialize the domain objects. This can simplify tasks in complex
                    domains, by
                    avoiding the need to synchronize the data model and the business domain, while improving
                    performance,
                    scalability, and responsiveness. It can also provide consistency for transactional data, and
                    maintain full
                    audit trails and history that can enable compensating actions.</span></p>
            <h4 class="c28" id="h.26in1rg"><span class="c19">Context and problem</span></h4>
            <p class="c12"><span class="c0">Most applications work with data, and the typical approach is for the
                    application to
                    maintain the current state of the data by updating it as users work with it. For example, in the
                    traditional
                    Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) model a typical data process is to read data from the
                    store, make some
                    modifications to it, and update the current state of the data with the new values&mdash;often by
                    using
                    transactions that lock the data. The CRUD approach has some limitations:</span></p>
            <ul class="c29 lst-kix_list_15-0 start">
                <li class="c15"><span class="c0">CRUD systems perform update operations directly against a data store,
                        which can

                        it
                        requires.</span></li>
                <li class="c15"><span class="c0">In a collaborative domain with many concurrent users, data update
                        conflicts are

                <li class="c15"><span class="c0">Unless there&#39;s an additional auditing mechanism that records the
                        details of
                        each operation in a separate log, history is lost.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="c28" id="h.lnxbz9"><span class="c19">Solution</span></h4>
            <p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Event Sourcing pattern defines an approach to handling operations on
                    data
                    that&#39;s driven by a sequence of events, each of which is recorded in an append-only store.
                    Application code
                    sends a series of events that imperatively describe each action that has occurred on the data to
                    the event
                    store, where they&#39;re persisted. Each event represents a set of changes to the data. The events
                    are
                    persisted in an event store that acts as the system of record (the authoritative data source) about
                    the current
                    state of the data. The event store typically publishes these events so that consumers can be
                    notified and can
                    handle them if needed. Consumers could, for example, initiate tasks that apply the operations in
                    the events to
                    other systems, or perform any other associated action that&#39;s required to complete the
                    operation. Notice
                    that the application code that generates the events is decoupled from the systems that subscribe to
                    the events.</span></p>
            <p class="c12"><span class="c0">Typical uses of the events published by the event store are to maintain
                    materialized
                    views of entities as actions in the application change them, and for integration with external
                    systems. For
                    example, a system can maintain a materialized view of all customer orders that&#39;s used to
                    populate parts of
                    the UI. As the application adds new orders, adds or removes items on the order, and adds shipping
                    information,
                    the events that describe these changes can be handled and used to update the materialized view.</span></p>
            <p class="c12"><span class="c0">In addition, at any point it&#39;s possible for applications to read the
                    history of
                    events, and use it to materialize the current state of an entity by playing back and consuming all
                    the events
                    related to that entity. This can occur on demand to materialize a domain object when handling a
                    request, or
                    through a scheduled task so that the state of the entity can be stored as a materialized view to
                    support the
                    presentation layer.</span></p>
            <p class="c12"><span class="c0">The figure &#8470;3 below shows an overview of the pattern, including some
                    of the
                    options for using the event stream such as creating a materialized view, integrating events with
                    external
                    applications and systems, and replaying events to create projections of the current state of
                    specific entities.</span></p>
            <p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Event Sourcing pattern provides the following advantages:</span></p>
            <ul class="c29 lst-kix_list_16-0 start">
                <li class="c6"><span class="c0">Events are immutable and can be stored using an append-only operation.
                        The user
                        interface, workflow, or process that initiated an event can continue, and tasks that handle the
                        events can
                        run in the background. </span></li>
                <li class="c6"><span class="c0">Events are simple objects that describe some action that occurred,
                        together with
                        any associated data required to describe the action represented by the event. Events don&#39;t
                        directly
                        update a data store. They&#39;re simply recorded for handling at the appropriate time. </span></li>
                <li class="c6"><span class="c0">Events typically have meaning for a domain expert, whereas
                        object-relational
                        impedance mismatch can make complex database tables hard to understand. Tables are artificial
                        constructs
                        that represent the current state of the system, not the events that occurred.</span></li>
                <li class="c6"><span class="c0">Event sourcing can help prevent concurrent updates from causing
                        conflicts because
                        it avoids the requirement to directly update objects in the data store.</span></li>
                <li class="c6"><span class="c0">The append-only storage of events provides an audit trail that can be
                        used to
                        monitor actions taken against a data store, regenerate the current state as materialized views
                        or
                        projections by replaying the events at any time, and assist in testing and debugging the
                        system. In
                        addition, the requirement to use compensating events to cancel changes provides a history of
                        changes that
                        were reversed, which wouldn&#39;t be the case if the model simply stored the current state.
                    </span></li>
                <li class="c12 c58"><span class="c0">The event store raises events, and tasks perform operations in
                        response to
                        those events. This decoupling of the tasks from the events provides flexibility and
                        extensibility. Tasks
                        know about the type of event and the event data, but not about the operation that triggered the
                        event. In
                        addition, multiple tasks can handle each event. This enables easy integration with other
                        services and
                        systems that only listen for new events raised by the event store.</span></li>
